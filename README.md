# ReviewBar v2 üõçÔ∏è

An Augmented Product Review App that revolutionizes how consumers access and share product information through barcode scanning technology.

## üìñ Description

In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and an ever-increasing range of market offerings, consumers are often overwhelmed when making purchase decisions. While online reviews and ratings serve as valuable resources, accessing this information quickly and conveniently‚Äîespecially in physical retail settings‚Äîremains a challenge.

Modern consumers face a flood of choices across diverse product categories, from electronics and fashion to household items and beyond. The absence of credible, easily accessible information can leave users uncertain about whether a product will truly meet their expectations.

ReviewBar is designed to address this challenge. It is a cutting-edge mobile web application that provides a reliable source of authentic and diverse product reviews, fostering confident decision-making and informed purchases. The app enables users to add reviews for products they‚Äôve experienced and check existing reviews before buying, all through a seamless and intuitive interface.

The application leverages modern technologies such as barcode scanning and user-generated content to deliver a fast, efficient, and interactive shopping experience. By utilizing the globally recognized Universal Product Code (UPC) system, regulated by GS1 standards and locally administered by GS1 Lanka, the app ensures accuracy and uniqueness in product identification.
